          message: "The application contains an embedded resource adapter descriptor\
            \ ('ra.xml'), which implements the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for\
            \ certain Enterprise Information Systems (EIS).\n\n                JCA\
            \ often uses tightly coupled interactions between the connector and the\
            \ application. Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud environment because\
            \ of scalability problems.\n\n                Recommendation: Review the\
            \ purpose of the resource adapter to determine whether it is required\
            \ in a cloud environment."

            (SAR) deployments using the JBoss specific `jboss-service.xml` and `jboss-beans.xml`
            service-style descriptors were used by the application server to create
            MBeans based on JBoss Beans. The internal architecture has changed in
            JBoss EAP 6+ and is no longer based on an MBean JMX architecture.

            which is why everything was an MBean, though most of the MBean functionality
            still worked in JBoss EAP 5. JBoss EAP 6 is no longer based on Mbeans,
            and the Mbeans which are seen in jconsole are actually just facades over
            the JBoss management API, so declaring Mbean dependencies on any other
            Mbeans that appear to be JBoss Mbeans does not work since they are not
            real Mbeans.'

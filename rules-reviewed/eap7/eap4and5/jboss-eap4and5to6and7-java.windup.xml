            JBoss specific. In JBoss EAP 6+ these mbean-related components (i.e.,
            `org.jboss.mx.*`) have been removed in an effort to make the container
            more Java EE 6 specification compliant. One will need to find an equivalent
            replacement: for class `MBeanProxyExt.create()` one can use `JMX.newMBeanProxy()`.'

            title: How to implement MBeans in JBoss EAP 6
          message: JMX / MBeans is still fully supported as it is in the JDK specification.
            If your MBeans were extending the old JBoss EAP MBean support classes
            such as `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBean` and `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBeanSupport`,
            these do not exist in JBoss EAP 6+. These classes were hooked into the
            kernel in previous versions of JBoss EAP where everything was basically
            turned into an MBean.

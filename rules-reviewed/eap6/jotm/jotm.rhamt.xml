            title: Using transaction services by JTOM on EAP 6
          message: 'The modules required by JOTM''s JTA implementation are not loaded
            by default on EAP6+. This likely results in a "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
            sun/rmi/server/UnicastServerRef" exception when it is deployed. To solve
            this issue it is highly recommended to use JTA provided by JBoss EAP since
            JOTM is not maintained anymore. If you want to stick with JOTM, you can
            add "sun/rmi/server" as system export in your applications deployment-structure.xml
            as described in [this knowledge base article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1217863).'

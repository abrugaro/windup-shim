          description: The application has a Seam library embedded. While official
            support for Seam 2.2 applications was dropped in JBoss EAP 6, it was still
            possible to configure dependencies for JSF 1.2 and Hibernate 3 to allow
            Seam 2.2 applications to run on that release. Seam 2.3 should work on
            JBoss EAP 6 even some framework features and integrations from Seam 2.2
            are not supported. Red Hat JBoss EAP 7, which now includes JSF 2.2 and
            Hibernate 5, does not support Seam 2.2 or Seam 2.3 due to end of life
            of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit. It is recommended that you rewrite
            your Seam components using CDI beans. In the links below there are the
            instructions to enable alternatives for both EAP 6 and 7

            title: The application uses Quartz to scheduled jobs
          message: "Scheduled jobs, such as Quartz Scheduler tasks or cron jobs, can't\
            \ be used with App Service.\n                        App Service won't\
            \ prevent you from deploying an application containing scheduled tasks\
            \ internally.\n                        However, if your application is\
            \ scaled out, the same scheduled job may run more than once per scheduled\
            \ period.\n                        This situation can lead to unintended\
            \ consequences.\n\n                        Inventory any scheduled jobs,\
            \ inside or outside the application process."

          message: 'Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted
            by node failure. Each node in the cluster shares information about ongoing
            sessions and can take over sessions if another node disappears. In a cloud
            environment, however, data in the memory of a running container can be
            wiped out by a restart. Recommendations * Review the session replication
            usage and ensure that it is configured properly. * Disable HTTP session
            clustering and accept its implications. * Re-architect the application
            so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data
            grid. A remote data grid has the following benefits: * The application
            is more scaleable and elastic. * The application can survive EAP node
            failures because a JVM failure does not cause session data loss. * Session
            data can be shared by multiple applications.'

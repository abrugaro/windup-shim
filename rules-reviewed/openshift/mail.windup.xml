          message: The configuration parameters of SMTP services for outbound mail
            may contain environment-specific values such as static IP addresses, host
            names, properties, credentials, or certificates. Recommendations * In
            a cloud environment, mail systems should be considered backing services
            and treated like attached resources. * Ensure that the configuration of
            the underlying outbound mail connection is not environment-specific. *
            In OpenShift Container Platform, store configuration parameters as environment
            variables or in a ConfigMap.

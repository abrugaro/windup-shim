    description: This ruleset provides analysis in both JBoss EAP 5 and JBoss EAP
      6 that may require individual attention when migrating to JBoss EAP 7+. The
      purpose of this ruleset common to those two major JBoss EAP versions is to avoid
      duplication of rules in rulesets dedicated to either version.

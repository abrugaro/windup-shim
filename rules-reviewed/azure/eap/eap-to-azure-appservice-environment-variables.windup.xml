          message: App Service - The application reads environment variables. Any
            environment variables used in the code will need to be defined as App
            Settings, which are exposed as environment variables in App Service. Any
            System properties that the code depends on will need to be provided either
            in a custom Startup Script or by defining an App Setting with the name
            JAVA_OPTS and include any system properties in it.

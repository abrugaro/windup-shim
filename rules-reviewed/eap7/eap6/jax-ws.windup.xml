              message: "EAP 7 uses JAX-WS 2.2 style constructors with the `javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature`\
                \ class to build clients that are injected into web service references\
                \ (i.e. using the `@WebServiceRef` annotation).  \n              \
                \                  This means that user provided service classes injected\
                \ by the container must implement JAX-WS 2.2 or later.  \n       \
                \                         The class must be changed to add the constructor\

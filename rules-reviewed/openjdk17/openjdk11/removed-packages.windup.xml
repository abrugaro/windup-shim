          message: The Nashorn scripting implementation has been removed from OpenJDK
            15 onwards. The javax.script API is still present and third party implementations,
            such as Rhino or Nashorn itself, can be installed if needed. Any references
            to its packages should be removed or substituted with the third party
            implementations.

    description: This ruleset provides analysis of WebSphere proprietary classes and
      constructs that may require individual attention when migrating to JBoss EAP
      6+. Specifically, this ruleset catches proprietary references that did not have
      more specific hints or classifications added to them.

                It probably does not need to be migrated. However the IBM DB2 driver
                should be configured properly.
